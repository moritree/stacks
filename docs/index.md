# Welcome to Stacks

Stacks is a programming environment which designed to be accessible to people without programming experience,
while remaining effective for more advanced creations. Stacks is currently in very early development.

## Why does Stacks exist?

I spent a lot of time as a kid making games in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (and sometimes other educational
programming tools like [Alice](https://www.alice.org/) or [GameSalad](https://gamesalad.com/)). I'm really glad I had
that, and the familiarity it gave me with basic program flow and manipulation gave me a head start in learning "real"
programming later. But I've always been frustrated by the limits of these tools and ways in which they sometimes even
get in the way of learning.

Programming tools aimed at educating non-technical beginners, particularly children, have a frustrating habit of
arbitrarily limiting what you can do. In trying to protect people from overwhelming complexity, they lock you out and
don't let you even try hard things. As a result, once you reach the natural limit of these tools, there's still a huge
jump to make to general purpose programming. I don't think this is inevitable, though. I'm trying to build something
which can bridge this gap.

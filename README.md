A Tauri (Rust) app, using TypeScript with Preact for the frontend and Lua for model (and scripting, later).
So WIP, I'm not even going to explain what this is for yet.

# Run locally
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/moritree/stacks.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

I'm sure you can figure out installing any prerequisites along the way.

## Development
To run the app in development mode:

```
yarn tauri dev
```

## Build from source
To build the application binary for your system:

```
yarn tauri build
```

> ### âš  Testing
> *(@ me, in case I forget and lose time again)* Make sure to **test the production build** as well as dev mode!
